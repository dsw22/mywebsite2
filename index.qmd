# Introduction

Hi there! My name is Wilfred and this is my webpage. If you ever need help.

Here, I'm going to show you a plot of miles per gallon (mpg) by vehicle weight in tons (wt)

```{r, fig1}
library(plotly)
library(ggplot2)
library(hrbrthemes)

p <- mtcars |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point(size = 5, shape = 21, color = "white", fill = "steelblue", alpha = 0.5) +
  theme_ipsum() +
  labs(y = "Fuel economy (mpg)", x = "Vehicle weight (tons)", 
       title = "As vehicle weight increases, fuel economy decreases")

ggplotly(p)

```
